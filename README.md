# Interactive Heart Animation for Olivia


A beautiful, interactive particle heart animation created with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The particles form a pink heart shape that responds to mouse movement, creating an engaging visual effect.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Particles**: Heart-shaped arrangement of particles that respond to mouse movement
- **Dynamic Animation**: Particles move away from the cursor when approached, then gently return to their original positions
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts to different screen sizes
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify colors, particle count, and message text
- **Pure JavaScript**: No external libraries required

## 🚀 Demo

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/heart-animation-for-olivia.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd heart-animation-for-olivia
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the animation.

## 💻 Usage

Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser. Move your mouse cursor near the heart to see the particles react to your movement.

### Customization

You can easily customize the animation by modifying the following variables in the JavaScript code:

- `particleCount`: Change the number of particles in the heart
- `mouse.radius`: Adjust how close the mouse needs to be to affect particles
- Colors: Modify the particle colors by changing the color values
- Message: Edit the message in the HTML to personalize it

## 🔄 How It Works

The animation uses the HTML5 Canvas API to create and manipulate thousands of particles that form the shape of a heart. Each particle:

1. Is positioned initially using a parametric heart equation
2. Detects the distance to the mouse cursor
3. Moves away from the cursor when it gets too close
4. Gradually returns to its original position when the cursor moves away

The result is an interactive, fluid animation that responds to user input.
